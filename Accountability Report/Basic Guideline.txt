What I need: 
Where the school is: Done 
What is around the school (Industry)
Is the school techology based or not? 
Student teacher ratio
Percent with reduced lunch
Test scores: Done

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun Things: See what happens when you try to draw a classification boundry around points (Can I even do this with arc, who knows) 


Otherwise: to what extent can latitiutde and longitude predict test scores?
